# EXAMPLE 6 --- GROUPING

# """
# Sometimes we might want to match a regex pattern but only capture a
# portion (or group) of it. Regex provides a simple way of doing this
# by using the parenthesis (). We can define the group we want to capture
# by surrounding it with () within the regex pattern.

#
# regex = "data\s(\w+)\s"
# '''
# Match the word after 'data'
# '''
# for matched in re.findall(regex, my_str):
#     print(matched)


# EXAMPLE 7 --- COMPILING

"""
SO FAR, we have mainly used module-level functions provided by re directly. 
Another way to perform regex pattern matching is to *compile* the pattern first
and then call the functions on the compiled object. 

In general, we can use the compiled approach if we are going to use 
the pattern MULTIPLE times; otherwise, itâ€™s simpler to use the module-level
(non-compiled) functions.
